👋 **Welcome to my GitHub!**  
I was supposed to be smashing birdies on the badminton court, but somehow I’m here smashing code and algorithms instead. Guess I’m serving both: shuttlecocks and neural networks! 🏸🤖

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Flutter, FastAPI, NestJS, Docker, PyTorch  
🤖 **AI/ML:** I preprocess data, train models, and deploy them faster than I can finish a shuttle rally.  
🎾 **Hobbies:** Crushing birdies, optimizing code, and seeing how many layers of AI I can stack before it crashes.  
🎯 **Ninja Philosophy:** I think different... just like everyone else.
